# Karpathy Zero to Hero — Practice

This repository tracks my **hands-on implementations and projects**
from **Andrej Karpathy’s “Neural Networks from Scratch / Zero to Hero” series**.

Each sub-project lives in its **own dedicated repository** and contains:
- clean implementation code
- small experiments and sanity checks
- notes and insights from the videos

This repo serves as a **learning index and roadmap**, not a code dump.

## 🧠 What “Completed” means (micrograd)

For **micrograd**, completion means:
- Reverse-mode autodiff engine built from scratch
- MLP (Neuron / Layer / MLP) implemented on top
- Training loop on a toy dataset
- Gradient flow verified via backprop
- Graph visualization using Graphviz
- Code written incrementally while learning (not copy-pasted)

The original micrograd repo is forked **only for reference and traceability**.

## 🎯 Goal

My goal is to:
- Understand every concept deeply
- Implement everything from first principles
- Use modern Python and clean project structure
- Document learning clearly and honestly
- Showcase results in a professional way
